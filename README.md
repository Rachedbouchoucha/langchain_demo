# LangChain Demo

Welcome to the LangChain Demo! This guide will help you set up and run the LangChain demonstration code on your system. Just follow these simple steps:

## Installation

1. **Install Required Packages**: Begin by installing the necessary Python packages. Open your terminal and execute the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Configure OpenAI API Key**: To use the OpenAI API, you need to provide your API key. Locate the `.env` file in the project directory and replace the placeholder with your OpenAI API key.

## Running the Code

After the setup, you can run different parts of the demo:

- **Testing Chains**: To test the chains functionality, run `chains_main.py` 
- **Testing Agents**: If you want to test the agents, use `agents_main.py`

Feel free to explore and modify the code to see how different components interact in the LangChain framework!
